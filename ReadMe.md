This repo supports a pair of [talks](https://www.meetup.com/hackerdojo/events)
given Tuesday June 18th & July 2nd at the [Hacker Dojo](https://www.hackerdojo.com).
Start out by following these setup instructions.

# setup

Either tell your IDE to clone the repo to a convenient local folder,
or follow these instructions at a bash prompt.

1. `cd` somewhere suitable and then clone in the usual way: `$ git clone https://github.com/jhanley634/dojo-2024-06-18-geocode.git`
2. `cd` into the repo: `$ cd dojo-2024-06-18-geocode`
3. Create a new virtual environment: `$ make venv` (actually just `make` suffices)
4. Activate the venv: `$ source ~/.venv/dojo-geocode/bin/activate`
